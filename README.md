## üî® Project functionality

The program was developed to share a website featuring Christmas messages. To achieve this, users accessing the chatbot need to input a code, which retrieves their specific data from the API and displays it. Furthermore, the conversational bot offers various options to spread the Christmas spirit in an enjoyable manner, including a quiz, a playlist, an option to send messages, among others.
